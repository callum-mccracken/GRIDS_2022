# HPGe experiment from GRIDS

Goal:
- determine the identity of a mystery sample

Steps:
- physical setup: get detector readout in a file with 8000ish channels
- use 3 calibration sources to see which channel corresponds to which energy
- use background run to figure out the activity from each peak in the 3 sources
- realize that the peak and activity correspond to KCl
