# TACTIC experiment from GRIDS

Goal:
- Using TACTIC TPC detector, calculate properties of Am-241 alpha decay

Steps:
- Physical setup: play with a bunch of oscilloscope settings
- Get data with digitizer
- Calculate things like drift velocity of electrons in the TPC gas

Things to Calculate:
- drift velocity and its voltage / position dependence
- reconstructed trajectories

Runs:
- with different cathode voltages
- with different GEM voltages
- with the source pushed in or not
